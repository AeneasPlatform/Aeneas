# Aeneas Platform Node

Aeneas is an open source blockchain platform which powers a concept of 
decentralized city-state. Aeneas maintains different transaction types, 
includes smart-contracts and operates via PoS consensus algorithm.

## Our vision

How people will live in future? They will live in decentralized city-states. 

Traditional countries and their borders will loose their initial meaning, 
and even it wouldn’t be so much important in what real city you live. 
It will be much more valuable to own digital assets and virtual estate than 
material one. Cryptocurrencies will become fully acceptable money and 
smart-contracts will be the base for business agreements, enterprise 
algorithms and laws.

So, what is Decentralized City-State? It’s a peer-to-peer network powered 
by Aeneas blockchain. Each scrap of data, transaction or written code uploaded 
to blockchain will be safely stored and will work exactly as programmed.

Each node is a stakeholder of network and works enabling the security, 
governance and transaction processing without any third party interference.
Aeneas is a public general-purposed platform for the e-commerce, tokenization, 
voting, different services and the Internet-of-Things.

Aeneas could be used as payment system and there is an utility token called Ash 
that is available for user transactions.
